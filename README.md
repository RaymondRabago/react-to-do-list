# React To-Do List

Hello! Welcome to my first React Application.\
This is a simple React To-do List application, where the user can create, view and delete item/task in the list.

In this Project I used the following tools:\
[Create React Application](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)\
[React Transition Group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)
